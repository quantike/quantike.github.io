howdy, i'm ike

- i love to code
- i (occasionally) blog about how i solve problems, things i think are fascinating, or mundane things i think are explained poorly
- i am fascinated by databases, distributed systems, and machine learning
- my background is in physics, nuclear engineering, and high-performance computing
- my favorite equation is:

$$\dfrac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\lambda N(t)$$
